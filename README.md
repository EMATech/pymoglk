=======

A helper class for driving [Matrix Orbital](https://www.matrixorbital.com/) GLK series LCD.

Tested with a [GLK19264-7T-1U-USB-WB](https://www.matrixorbital.com/glk19264a-7t-1u) (PCB R1.0, FW V5.9).

Uses [PySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial/) to communicate with the LCD.

### Status
Under development.

Most features are implemented except for advanced memory management functions (Fonts, bitmaps, filesystemâ€¦).

Feel free to help!
